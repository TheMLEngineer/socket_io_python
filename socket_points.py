# In internet we have server and client
# Sockets are base of internet
# Port number and connection type , 2 imp. concepts
# If a machine provides different services each service will have unique port number
# Use available port number , If tomcat installed it uses 8080 port , then don't use 8080 on other services

# TCP --> Connection Oriented Network (sends data only after connection)
# UDP --> Connection Less Network (Dis Adv. Not sure if packet has reached other side)
